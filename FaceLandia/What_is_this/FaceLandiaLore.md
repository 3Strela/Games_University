# FaceLandia's Lore

This's my favorite game... I liked to spend some time on it.

For this reason, I'll show some interesting things about it.

First of all, welcome to Faceland. The Faces' kingdom.

In this game, you'll need to beat two opponents depending what character you choose.

Each character have ambitions and wishes. For this reason, all of them will participate in the labyrinth of Faceland, also called LabiFace.

LabiFace is a tournament that bring out the fastest Face and crown it the new KingFace or QueenFace.

The actual game is: 
- Will you give in to greed and open the magic chests??
- Are you prepare to pick the right choices in LabiFace??
- Have fun and discover more about this little and simple game.

I really enjoyed spend 6-8 hours on it. I hope you like it even you play only 3 minutes.

I used Graph theory(flood fill) to make the opponent moves. See it moving by itself was made me so glad =)
