# Why did I do this Cheap Chess game?

Well, when I was a kid I used to play chess. For this reason, I thought code a chess game would be easy and cool.

It was cool to do, but it was really chalenger implement some details =)

Just the basics rules were implemented and the bot is very silly.

# How to use?

You're free to use this code was you want.

Actually, just use it if you're brave enough to see someone's second time programming a game.

Just install this ["Chess"](https://github.com/3Strela/Games_University/tree/main/Kind_of_Chess/Chess) folder and play "main.py".
