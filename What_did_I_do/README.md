# Why did I do this?

This was my first game and... what a shame ;__;

I don't want to talk about it much.

But, if you wanna know: this was supposed to be a hangman game...

I mean, it works. But, it could be better implemented

# Hangman game

In order to get good grades, this game was made using graphics library and an sus simple logic.

# How to use?

You're free to use this code was you want.

Actually, just use it if you're brave enough to see someone's first time programming a game.

Just install the "hangman_game" folder and play "main.py".
